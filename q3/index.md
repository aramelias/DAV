Judging by the linear regression producing an uphill line for both BMI and food price, there is a clear positive correlation between the two.

It is possible that this is caused by the increasing wealth in all countries, making for a larger available amount and higher quality of food products as well as greater food consumption at the same time, which causes both the food price and BMI to increase.
