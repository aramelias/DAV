## Attribute Classification
Seeing as the other group members are beginning to preprocess the dataset, it is necessary to classify the attributes so they can be smoothed or otherwise adapted if need be. The classification can be found in attributes.md.

## EDA
The part of EDA designated to me is the univariate graphical and non-graphical analysis. As most data in the dataset is categorized by country and region, simply generating a plot of every number in the "price" column will not yield any useful results.

A box plot has been made of the mean of all product prices per country, meaning that the list of figures the plot is based on is the list of average prices -- one per country.
Because the box plot created using pyplot is extremely condensed to also fit the outliers into the same image, another box plot has been made where only the values under 6.0 are taken into account.
