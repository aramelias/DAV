# Question 1: Time Correlations
*Are there any food prices that show negative/positive correlation, and is this correlation present throughout the years, or perhaps only in certain period? Can you perhaps detect possible ingredients of a certain other food product?*

<hr>

Nine countries show a correlation between the prices of different kinds of food. In addition, the following developments have been distinguished:

<!-- Benin graph -->

In Benin, all food prices rise from 2006 to 2008. When the prices of rice and beans increases, the prices of corn and sorghum decrease.

<!-- Nepal graph -->

In Nepal, the prices of rice and wheat have a high correlation of 0.9982. Both stop increasing in 2004, then follow a nearly parallel path all the way up until 2008.

<!-- Niger graph -->

In Niger, the prices of corn, sorghum and millet strongly correlate, but that of beans does not follow the same development. Peaks can also be seen in 1999 and 2001, after which the price remains relatively high.

<!-- Senegal graph -->

The food prices in Senegal all correlate strongly. Sorghum and millet, both being types of wheat, have a correlation of 0.9969. Additionally, all prices show a peak increase in 2004 immediately followed by a decline in the next year.

<!-- Sudan graph -->

In Sudan, the prices of almost all products show a strong correlation. Like in Senegal and Niger, sorghum and millet have a high corellation: 0.9956.

<!-- South Sudan graph -->

South Sudan shows a similar correlation: from 2012 to 2015, all food prices remain relatively the same, but after this period they fluctuate every year.

<!-- Tanzania graph -->

In Tanzania, corn and rice have a correlation of 0,9812.

<!-- Red beans graph -->

The price of red beans has a similarity of 0.9992 across all countries, meaning the price develops at an extremely similar rate all over the world.

<!-- Graphs: wheat AND bread -->

Counterintuitive as it may seem, the price of bread does not show a particularly strong correlation with that of wheat in any country. The price of wheat increases over the years, while that of bread stays relatively the same, increasing and decreasing at different moments compared to the price of its main ingredient.
