# Question 2: Spatial Correlations
*Do countries in similar regions, also show similar price differences? And if differences occur, can you find a potential explanation?*

<hr>

Generally speaking, most countries that occupy the same region show similar fluctuations in food price. Moreover, most trends in the price of rice -- an almost universally available crop -- tend to show up in more than one region across the world.

One example of this is the peak in 2009-2010, which can be seen in all regions. This peak is also visible in the overview of the average price of rice per region, with the Middle East being the most affected.

Of course, there are also developments that can be seen in multiple countries within the same region, but not anywhere or everywhere else. For example, Western Africa as a whole (seen below) shows a peak in the price of rice in 2003 that can hardly be detected in other areas.

A few exceptions of this are as follows:

As visible in the graph for Western Africa, Nigeria showed a far higher rice price compared to the rest of Western Africa up until 2015: $3 compared to the $1 average.

In addition, Haiti shows a far higher price than not only the rest of the Caribbean region, but the rest of the islands across the world as well.
