# Question 6: Trends
*Is there a correlation between geographical location of a country and its ratio between food price and BMI over time?*

<hr>

The answer is yes; both the average BMI and food price (in this case, the price of rice in all its forms) increase at similar rates in any given location. In addition, a larger difference between lowest and highest value of one statistic within a region almost always means a larger difference in the other.

There is also a clear connection between geographical location and BMI: countries within the same region tend to have a similar average BMI.

The only exception to this statement is that the *ratio* between price and BMI does not change in similar ways for countries within the same region.
