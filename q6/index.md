# Question 6: Trends
*Is there a correlation between geographical location of a country and its ratio between food price and BMI over time?*

<hr>

The answer is yes; both the average BMI and food price (in this case, the price of rice in all its forms) increase at similar rates in any given location. In addition, a larger difference between lowest and highest value of one statistic within a region almost always means a larger difference in the other.

There is also a clear connection between geographical location and BMI: countries within the same region tend to have a similar average BMI.

The only exception to this statement is that the *ratio* between price and BMI does not change in similar ways for countries within the same region.

Another detail worth noting is that there is one outlier far below the displayed range that shows every other country in the world. Syria, which was omitted from our measurements, would have been an outlier along the horizontal axis.
