Welcome to the project page of Group 27 of Data Analysis and Visualization, or DAV for short. Here, our research and conclusions drawn from the Food Prices dataset as well as a few supplementary datasets are neatly displayed in the form of six question-and-answer pages.

Our group consists of Anne Boomsma, Aram Elias, Tim Müller and Mirka Schoute.

In this project, we analyzed the dataset of the prices of various food products over the past two decades in more than 70 countries all over the world. In addition, we added a similar dataset of the average BMI in each country to the mix to see if there were any connections.

## Question 1: Time Correlations
Are there any food prices that show a correlation, maybe within a certain time frame? Can you perhaps detect possible ingredients of a certain other food product?

## Question 2: Spatial Correlations
Do countries in similar regions, also show similar price differences?

## Question 3: Price and BMI
Can we see any correlations between the BMI and food prices of countries?

## Question 4: Inner Regions
Is there a correlation between food prices in the same province/state in a country?

## Question 5: Currency
If the exchange rate to the dollar fluctuates, do the food prices follow?

## Question 6: Trends
Is there a correlation between geographic location and the BMI to food prices ratio?

## Other Findings
While analyzing the data, our group also made a few interesting discoveries.
* Due to a heavy monsoon in the Khulna region in Bangladesh in 2008, the price of most food products (including rice) was temporarily much higher than it was in the other parts of the country.
* There has been an incredible rise in food prices in Syria since 2011, most likely due to its civil war and violent conflicts cutting off access to food in many areas, an issue that has since been worked on. Due to these extreme numbers compared to those of the surrounding countries, Syria’s statistics are considered an outlier and have been removed to provide a more accurate picture of the rest of the world. A similar development took place in South Sudan in 2016 after a coup, but this didn’t affect the statistics as much and was therefore not removed.
* Last but not least, the large increase in food prices in Tanzania in 2012-2013 can be attributed to the heavy drought affecting the area in that period, at the end of which the food prices immediately began to drop back to normal.
